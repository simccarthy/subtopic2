 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This site provides a timeline of the beginnings of virtual reality to the present. This includes the years and photographs of each invention dating back to 1938. This is when stanley Weinbaum released Pygamalion's spectacles, a science fiction story. The main charcter wears a pair of googles that transports him to a fictional work. Many inventors wanted to make this story come to life by creating this alternate reality. In the 1960s a few inventors tried creating a VR headset. These headsets were heavy and lacked quality. VR wasn't seen as a popular device at this time. However by 2014 many well known companies released their own VR headsets with never before seen graphics. With trial and error virtual reality headsets have become widly popular around the world. In 2024 VR has become more immersive and complex than every before.</span><br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>This site consists of a timeline as well. However, this article took a more stricter scope of virtual reality focusing on Panoramic paintings. The earliest attempt at VR is the 360-degree murals from the nineteeth century.The paintings would fill the viewers entire vision which could make them feel present in the scene that was painted. When people think of VR they typically think of devices so this is an interesting approach to VR. This article goes into further detail of how each invention was created as the other article did. However, this site included videos of the inventions to make the reader to better visualize the device.  &nbsp; </small><br>
